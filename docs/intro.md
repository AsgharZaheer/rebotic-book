# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Bridging the Digital Brain and the Physical Body

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This comprehensive curriculum covers the essential technologies and concepts needed to understand and develop advanced robotic systems.

### Course Modules

This course is organized into four comprehensive modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn about Robot Operating System 2, the middleware that enables communication between different robotic components.

2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explore simulation environments that allow you to test and validate robotic systems in virtual worlds.

3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Discover how artificial intelligence powers robotic decision-making and autonomous behavior.

4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Understand how robots perceive, interpret, and interact with the world through multimodal AI systems.

Each module contains detailed lessons, practical exercises, and hands-on projects to help you master these cutting-edge technologies.
